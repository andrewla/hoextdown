This is a space-indented code block.

    {
      /** JavaDoc with a {@link #somewhere}
       */
    }

The link is *not* an extended attribute!

    {
      /** Code with attribute
       */
    } {@ .codesample }

The above *is* an extended attribute, at least for now.
See [#62](https://github.com/kjdev/hoextdown/issues/62) for a discussion about
whether this kind of syntax should be supported.
