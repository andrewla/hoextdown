foo[^1]

[^1]: foo

      * list

      not in list

Here's a footnote [^2].

[^2]: Footnote text goes here.

Here is a footnote reference,[^3] and another.[^longnote]

[^3]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.
